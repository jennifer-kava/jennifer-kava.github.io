I am a sophomore in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Columbia University, working on the intersection of diffusion models and causal inference. 

Currently, I am a research assistant at Columbia University Department of Statistics under Prof. [Chenyang Zhong](https://sites.google.com/view/cyzhong/home?pli=1&authuser=1), and I also work with [Baohua Yan](https://bhyan.com) (PhD student). 

I am excited to connect and discuss potential opportunities!
